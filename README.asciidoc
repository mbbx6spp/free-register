== Free Register

This is a little library that provides a consistent API for the purpose of
registering services with a backend that could be used for such a thing, e.g.
Consul, Zookeeper, a key-value store, an internal service.

The purpose of this project is to allow me to learn and understand `non/cats`
project and use it as an illustrative example of how we could use the idea of
free monads in operations work.

=== Status
